C++ interviews insights
=======================

After a long pause, our team is now actively hiring in Madrid and Pune for a new exciting R&D orthodontics project. Over the past few weeks, I've participated in a dozen interviews, and unfortunately, we had to reject many candidates. In this post, I want to share some of my personal insights from those interviews, mainly to help future job seekers. Hiring strategies vary across companies, and even different teams within the same company may approach hiring differently. So, the observations below aren't universal. Still, I believe they can be helpful for C++ job seekers, especially those at the junior level. Since our team focuses on writing C++ code for 3D geometry, our technical interviews emphasize both C++ and computational geometry. Here I'll discuss only the C++ part and leave the latter aside.

We usually conduct two technical rounds (three in rare cases). The first round lasts about 30 minutes, and if it goes well, we invite the candidate for a second one, which takes 1.5 to 2 hours. At least two C++ developers and the team manager participate in the second round. However, since these notes are based on my personal insights and questions, I'll use the pronoun "I" in the discussion that follows.

In the first round, I don't ask candidates to write code — we simply discuss the basics of C++. The conversation may start with something from the interviewee's resume, but I often begin with the following question: "Can you name the main components of the C++ standard library?" Surprisingly, this question catches many candidates off guard. Some answer confidently, while others need a few hints to recall more than just containers. Components like  smart pointers and concurrency support come up much less often.

After some components are named, I typically dive into one of them — sometimes I make the choice, but I may also ask the candidate which one they would like to discuss. One question I might ask is to explain the difference between `std::vector` and `std::list`. If a candidate struggles to answer, I give some hints to guide them toward the correct response — I aim to avoid leaving questions completely unanswered. If the question is answered easily, we may move on to other containers. One question I enjoy asking is for candidates to explain in detail the difference between `std::set` and `std::multiset`. So, my first piece of advice: Make sure you have a solid understanding of the standard library's components. There is no need to memorize every member function of `std::string`, but, for example, I would expect even a junior developer to name most of the standard containers (there are 13 of them in C++17) and know that `std::vector` is mandated to be contiguous in memory.

If the first round goes well, we invite the candidate to the second one. For this round, I have a set of prepared questions — around 10 in total. The questions are arranged from simple to more difficult. Based on the candidate's responses, I decide which question to ask next. Most of the questions involve pieces of code with intentional issues. The task is to identify and fix the problems. These issues generally focus on core language features and the standard library, and they often serve as a springboard for follow-up discussions on a variety of topics. The depth of these discussions depends on the candidate's answers. Of course, there's no expectation to cover all the questions.

While I won't share the specific questions (it wouldn’t make much sense), I can share some topics that many candidates struggle with.

Core language knowledge is crucial. Be prepared to spot dangling references, understand that a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow, know move semantics inside and out, and understand when and how overload resolution is performed by the compiler, among many other things. The rule of 0/3/5 is important enough to highlight separately. You need to understand what the rule means, be able to spot violations, and know how to fix them. This includes knowing what the special member functions are and how to implement them if needed.

Another key area is containers. You should be familiar with the containers available in the standard library and understand how they are typically implemented. Knowing the underlying implementations will make it much easier for you to reason about issues such as iterator invalidation or the time complexity of operations on different containers. Additionally, you should know what is required to create containers for user-defined types.

The next important area to focus on is algorithms. The standard library offers many algorithms, and while you're not expected to list all of them, you should be familiar with commonly used ones like `std::reverse`, `std::rotate`, and `std::sort`. Have you heard of `std::nth_element`? I might ask about that one as well. It's important to understand that some algorithms impose restrictions on iterator types — know these restrictions and be prepared to explain them. For example, can you use `std::sort` with an `std::list`? If not, why?

If a candidate demonstrates a strong understanding of the basics, we might delve into more advanced topics, such as custom iterator implementations, type erasure, condition variables, and so on. However, I won't go into detail here, mainly because I don't have enough statistics — unfortunately, these discussions are quite rare in our interviews.

To summarize, my general advice is this: if you're a beginner, focus on mastering the basics of the core language and the standard library. I firmly believe that if you have a strong understanding of C++ fundamentals, you'll be able to fill in any gaps you encounter in your real work. Conversely, if your foundation is weak, no amount of coding puzzle solutions from "competitive coding" sites will matter — they won't prepare you for real-world programming tasks. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to programming puzzles, but tackle them **after** you've built a strong understanding of the language, not before. As someone wisely said, *"The basics are the building blocks of success. Master them, and the rest falls into place"*.

Finally, I'd like to recommend one of my favorite learning resources for beginners and beyond: the *"Back to Basics"* series from the [CppCon conference](https://www.youtube.com/@CppCon). You can easily find it on YouTube.

Good luck to everyone searching for a new job!
